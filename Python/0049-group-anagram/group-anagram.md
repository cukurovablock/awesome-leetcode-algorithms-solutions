# # [‚úÖ Counts the Frequencies to solve the üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Group Anagram Problem on üêç Python language](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/solutions/3587269/counts-the-frequencies-to-solve-the-group-anagram-problem-on-python-language/)

## Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
the approach counts the occurrences of each letter in the words and groups the anagrams together based on their letter counts using a dictionary.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $O(n)$ -->
The time complexity of the solution is $O(n \* k)$, where n is the number of words in the input list `strs` and k is the maximum length of the words. In the worst case, where all words have the same maximum length, the time complexity simplifies to $O(n \* m)$, where m is the maximum length of the words. The constant-time operations performed inside the loops do not significantly impact the overall time complexity. Thus, the solution has a linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input list and the maximum length of the words.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $O(n)$ -->
The space complexity of the solution is $O(n)$, where n is the number of words in the input list `strs`. The `ans` dictionary, which stores the groups of anagrams, is the main factor contributing to the space complexity. The additional space used for the `count` list and other variables is constant and does not significantly affect the overall space requirement. Hence, the space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input list.

        for s in strs: #¬†iterate of words
            count = [0] * 26 # 26 zero list for alpahabet
            for c in s: # iterate of letters
                count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1 # ord(c) gives ascii value 
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s) # add to word to list that related with key ()whic is count list)
